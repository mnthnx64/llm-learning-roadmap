# Regex - Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful pattern-matching tools used for text processing, validation, and extraction. They are fundamental to NLP preprocessing tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand regex syntax and patterns
- Use regex for text matching, searching, and extraction
- Apply regex for common NLP tasks (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)
- Recognize when regex is appropriate vs. when more advanced tools are needed

## Topics Covered

1. **Basic Patterns**: Literals, character classes, quantifiers
2. **Character Classes**: Digits, word characters, whitespace, custom classes
3. **Quantifiers**: `*`, `+`, `?`, `{n}`, `{n,m}`
4. **Anchors**: `^` (start), `$` (end), word boundaries
5. **Groups and Capturing**: Parentheses, non-capturing groups
6. **Alternation**: `|` (OR operator)
7. **Lookahead/Lookbehind**: Advanced assertions
8. **Practical Applications**: Email validation, phone numbers, text cleaning
